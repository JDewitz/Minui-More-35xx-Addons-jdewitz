Quick and dirty

Many of these cores come from Tomato and Onion! They work pretty well. This version does not use the new per-core configs Shaun has created and may break.

Separates subsystems-
32x
Sega CD
PC Engine CD/TG-16 CD

Separates without custom settings-
Famicom Disk System

Adds systems and cores-
CPS1
CPS2
Atari Lynx
Neo Geo
Neo Geo Pocket/Color
SNES MSU-1 Audio (SNES CD)



Bios needed:
Bios/
LYNX/lynxboot.img 
NEOGEO/neogeo.zip
PCECD/syscard3.pce
SEGACD/bios_CD_U.bin, bios_CD_E.bin, bios_CD_J.bin

For Sega CD, don't try any of the wondermega bios or anything crazy. Just get the standard 1.00 and 1.10 ones. 

Installation- Drop everything into the root of your SD Card. Do not write ANYTHING to the .system folder. 

Notes-
1. Most games work with these cores. Some games don't, like 1941 for CPS1 for example. Some games load and cause a hang.I don't support any of this and you're on your own, but most will work. 
2. The worst that could probably happen if you screw up is you'll need to reformat your SD card. You won't brick your device if you screw up, but I won't support you anyway. 
3. This pack is just for testing and is not official in any way. 
4. Some games just run slow. That's just how it is. 
5. Neo Geo sometimes loads slow. It depends on the game. 
6. Don't come to me asking for support. My releases should be considered skilless, unsupported hacks, even if they work fine.
